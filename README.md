# CoffeeAndShells
I've been wanting to make basic linux malware, so I did just that. This is a reverse shell with presistence via bash and delay to make it harder to detect by a user. Still in early stages of development. 
 
Please do not use this, but if you do, read the pastebin link, replace with your own pastebin link with ip and port. Also replpace the base files ip and port.

To do:

 
1. Encrypt shell trafic
 
2. Clean up output (make it non existent)

3. add a builder 
 
4. possibly add network spreader, screenshots, keylogger, and custom python execution 
 
5. Add a non root version


Done:
 
1. make shell
 
2. Add random delay to make it harder to find while looking at network traffic
 
3. Make presistent through bash

4. Fix most major errors

5. Make dropper within non staged malware
